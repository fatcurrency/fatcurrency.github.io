# Ectopic Gastric Mucosa Scintigraphy (SPECT) Protocol

## I. Basic Examination Information

- **Examination**: Ectopic gastric mucosa scintigraphy (SPECT)

- **Associated condition**: Meckel’s diverticulum

- **Radiopharmaceutical**: 99mTc-pertechnetate lavage solution (99mTcO4⁻)

- **Dose**: 5 mCi

- **Administration**: <span style="color: #ff1414">Bedside dynamic peripheral intravenous bolus injection</span>

## II. Pre‑examination Preparation

1. <span style="color: #ff1414">Fast for ≥4 hours before the scan</span> to avoid interference from gastric contents.

2. Remove all <span style="color: #ff1414">metal items</span> to prevent detector interference.

3. Establish a <span style="color: #ff1414">indwelling IV line</span> in advance for radiotracer injection.

## III. Acquisition Protocol

1. Position: <span style="color: #ff1414">Supine, head out</span>, routine <span style="color: #ff1414">anterior view</span> acquisition.

2. Field of view: from the <span style="color: #ff1414">xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis</span>, ensuring the entire abdomen is centered.

3. Injection/acquisition: use a <span style="color: #ff1414">bolus injection</span> and start <span style="color: #ff1414">dynamic acquisition</span> simultaneously.

## IV. Acquisition Workflow

1. Start <span style="color: #ff1414">dynamic acquisition</span> immediately after bolus injection, for 1 minute.

2. After dynamic imaging, perform <span style="color: #ff1414">functional imaging</span> for 30 minutes at 60 s/frame, total 30 frames.

3. At 1 hour post‑injection, acquire a <span style="color: #ff1414">static image for 2 minutes</span>.

4. At 2 hours post‑injection, acquire another <span style="color: #ff1414">static image for 2 minutes</span>.

## V. Special Considerations for Pediatric Patients (Chloral Hydrate Sedation)

Chloral hydrate is the first‑choice sedative for pediatric patients. The protocol is as follows:

### (1) Package Contents

1. One bottle of chloral hydrate concentrate (specification: 1.342 g : 1 g);

2. One bottle of syrup (diluent), 9 mL;

3. One dosing syringe;

4. One measuring cup.

### (2) Preparation Method

<span style="color: #001eff">1. Insert the dosing syringe through the small hole in the center of the concentrate bottle cap and withdraw all concentrate (to the 1.0 mark on the syringe);

<span style="color: #001eff">2. Insert the syringe needle through the round hole in the syrup bottle cap and inject all concentrate into the syrup;

<span style="color: #001eff">3. Shake the mixture vigorously at least three times to fully mix, producing the clinical solution (chloral hydrate syrup);

<span style="color: #001eff">4. Before use, open the cap as indicated by the arrow, pour the solution into the measuring cup, and administer the measured dose to the child.

### (3) Dosage

1. Routine dose: 30–50 mg/kg for pediatric sedation/hypnosis before sleep; maximum single dose ≤1 g;

2. Special populations: for preterm infants and neonates within 1 month, reduce the starting dose to 20–40 mg/kg as appropriate.

### (4) Safety Notes

1. Never administer chloral hydrate concentrate directly; it must be diluted in syrup to avoid mucosal injury.

2. Parents should wear disposable gloves during preparation to avoid skin/eye contact. If contact occurs, rinse immediately with copious water.

3. After adding concentrate to syrup, shake thoroughly to prevent inaccurate dosing or high‑concentration adverse reactions.

4. If bubbles appear when drawing concentrate, repeatedly aspirate/expel to remove air and ensure accurate dosing.

5. Observe the child after dosing to prevent vomiting that could lead to sedation failure or underdosing.

## VI. Additional Notes

### (1) Pathologic Basis of Ectopic Gastric Mucosa

Ectopic gastric mucosa refers to gastric mucosal tissue abnormally located in non‑gastric sites such as the esophagus or small intestine. It retains the ability to secrete acid and pepsin, which can cause local inflammation, ulcers, or bleeding. Common pediatric conditions include:

1. Meckel’s diverticulum: a remnant of the embryonic vitelline duct at the distal ileum. About 50% contain ectopic gastric mucosa and are a common cause of painless lower GI bleeding in children.

2. Small bowel duplication: congenital intestinal structural anomalies; some cases include ectopic gastric mucosa, presenting with hematochezia, recurrent abdominal pain, and anemia, often misdiagnosed as enteritis or routine GI bleeding.

### (2) Common Sites and Management Principles

Most commonly in the upper esophagus ("inlet patch"), appearing as small orange‑red patches on endoscopy, usually requiring no special treatment. Less commonly in the small intestine or duodenum. Recurrent bleeding, ulceration, obstruction, or recurrent abdominal pain in children may warrant surgical intervention based on clinical judgment.

### (3) Safety Statement

At conventional doses, chloral hydrate minimally depresses respiration and circulation and has a long history of safe pediatric use. SPECT is a non‑invasive radionuclide imaging technique; only light sedation is required, without the need for stronger sedatives or anesthetics.
