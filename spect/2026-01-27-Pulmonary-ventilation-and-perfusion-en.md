# Pulmonary Ventilation and Perfusion (V/Q) SPECT/CT Protocol

## I. Basic Examination Information

- **Examination**: Pulmonary ventilation + perfusion SPECT/CT

- **Examination name**: **<span style="color: #ff1414">VQ SPECT-CT CM</span>**

- **<span style="color: #ff1414">Ventilation agent</span>**: Radioaerosol 99mTc-DTPA solution (30 mCi/2 mL), i.e., <span style="color: #ff1414">99mTc-DTPA</span>

- **<span style="color: #ff1414">Perfusion agent</span>**: Macroaggregated albumin (MAA), dose 3–5 mCi, i.e., <span style="color: #ff1414">99mTc-MAA</span>

## II. Acquisition Protocol

Note: VENT = ventilation; PERF = perfusion. Stop by accumulated counts: ventilation 300k, perfusion 500k.

### (1) Ventilation acquisitions

1. <span style="color: #ff1414">ANT POST VENT</span> (anterior/posterior ventilation)

2. <span style="color: #ff1414">LAO RPO VENT</span> (left anterior oblique, right posterior oblique ventilation)

3. <span style="color: #ff1414">LLAT RLAT VENT</span> (left lateral, right lateral ventilation)

4. <span style="color: #ff1414">LPO RAO VENT</span> (left posterior oblique, right anterior oblique ventilation)

5. <span style="color: #ff1414">TOMO VENT</span> (ventilation SPECT; place as the last ventilation step)

### (2) Perfusion acquisitions

CT acquisition is included in the perfusion protocol; keep position and order consistent:

1. <span style="color: #ff1414">ANT POST PERF</span> (anterior/posterior perfusion)

2. <span style="color: #ff1414">LAO RPO PERF</span> (left anterior oblique, right posterior oblique perfusion)

3. <span style="color: #ff1414">LLAT RLAT PERF</span> (left lateral, right lateral perfusion)

4. <span style="color: #ff1414">LPO RAO PERF</span> (left posterior oblique, right anterior oblique perfusion)

5. <span style="color: #ff1414">TOMO PERF</span> (perfusion SPECT)

Ventilation includes four pairs of planar views (8 frames) plus one SPECT (TOMO).
Perfusion includes planar views, CT, and one SPECT (TOMO). Maintain identical patient positioning throughout.

## III. Pre‑examination Preparation

### (1) Ventilation preparation

1. Sequence: explicitly **place Tomo VENT last** so all planar views finish before SPECT.

2. Patient after aerosol inhalation may **rest 5 minutes** and is advised to use the restroom; **remove all metal items** to avoid detector interference, then return for scanning.

3. Positioning: **supine**, **head in**, **both arms above head**; leave adequate headroom to avoid blocking the lung FOV.

4. Table alignment: estimate couch position in software, then fine‑tune with the room handset; **synchronize table parameters across all sequences** to ensure consistent position.

### (2) Perfusion preparation

1. Patient: rest supine, keep calm; optional oxygen for 10 minutes to reduce pulmonary vasospasm that could lower local activity.

2. Tracer injection: generally <span style="color: #ff1414">supine injection</span>. Before injection, <span style="color: #ff1414">vigorously resuspend 99mTc‑MAA</span>; administer by slow IV push; **start imaging 5 minutes post‑injection**. For pulmonary hypertension flow assessment, sitting injection may be used.

3. Views: routine eight positions — anterior (ANT), posterior (POST), left lateral (LL), right lateral (RL), left posterior oblique (LPO) 30°, right posterior oblique (RPO) 30°, left anterior oblique (LAO) 30°, right anterior oblique (RAO) 30°. Stabilize posture to reduce motion artifacts.

## IV. Special Precautions for 99mTc‑MAA Injection

1. <span style="color: #ff1414">History</span>: severe pulmonary hypertension (tolerance to stairs/flat walking); significant right‑to‑left shunt (cardiac disease); albumin allergy (e.g., seafood allergies).

2. <span style="color: #ff1414">Resuspension</span>: 99mTc‑MAA is a suspension; aspirate some air, invert/shake repeatedly to fully resuspend; visually confirm no large aggregates before injection.

3. <span style="color: #ff1414">Air purging</span>: after resuspension, purge cautiously only to the hub; avoid excessive purging that wastes dose; consider tubing‑switch technique for safety.

4. <span style="color: #ff1414">Push rate</span>: inject very gently at a slow, even rate to avoid adverse reactions and distribution artifacts that degrade image quality.

## V. General Precautions

1. Breathing instruction: explain key points; keep breathing steady; clear sputum before inhaled technetium aerosol; avoid swallowing to prevent GI contamination.

2. Post‑dose care: advise mouth rinse and hydration after dosing; wear a mask while waiting to minimize aerosol dispersion.

3. Injection taboo: <span style="color: #ff1414">never aspirate (no flashback) during 99mTc‑MAA injection</span> to avoid blood mixing, large aggregates, artifacts, and risk of vascular obstruction.

4. Radiation hygiene: encourage fluids and frequent urination after the study; avoid close contact with children/pregnant women for 24 hours.

## VI. Supplementary Procedures and Instrument Parameters

### (1) Pulmonary ventilation imaging

#### 1) Equipment preparation

1. Aerosol nebulizer: connect nebulizer tubing and medical oxygen line in advance; check seals and operation.

2. Detector setup: low‑energy general‑purpose (LEGP) collimator; photopeak 140 keV, 20% window; 300–500k counts per frame.

#### 2) Operating procedure

1. Pre‑imaging: counsel the patient by a fume hood to reduce anxiety; mouthpiece bite with nose clip on; practice oxygen breathing to adapt to the rhythm.

2. Radioaerosol inhalation: load 20–40 mCi 99mTc‑DTPA (2–4 mL) into nebulizer; set flow 5–6 L/min; ensure adequate aerosolization; instruct deep inspiration and slow expiration for about 15–20 minutes to ensure sufficient pulmonary deposition.

3. Image acquisition: supine fixation; acquire planar images per protocol — ANT, POST, LLAT, RLAT, and obliques (8 frames total) — then run SPECT to complete ventilation imaging.

### (2) Pulmonary perfusion imaging

#### 1) Radiopharmaceutical specification

99mTc‑MAA suspension: adult activity 111–185 MBq (3–5 mCi); particle count 2×10^5–7×10^5 (average ~3.5×10^5); injection volume ≥1 mL.

#### 2) Instrument settings

FOV must cover both lungs; LEHR collimator; 500–800k counts per planar view; zoom 1.46; matrix 256×256; photopeak 140 keV, 20% window.

#### 3) SPECT acquisition

Preparation and injection as for planar imaging. Supine, arms up to expose chest; minimize detector‑to‑chest distance. LEHR or LEGP collimator; 360° rotation; step 6° (or 5.6°); 20–30 s/frame; acquire 60 or 64 frames; 140 keV, 20% window; matrix 64×64. Coach steady breathing to reduce motion. Reconstruct with filtering/back‑projection; generate axial, coronal, and sagittal slices with 3–6 mm thickness.

## VII. Imaging Principles

### (1) Ventilation (VENT)

Inhaled technetium gas or aerosol deposits in terminal bronchioles and alveoli. SPECT/CT maps the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of pulmonary radioactivity, reflecting airway patency, alveolar ventilation, and extent of involvement.

### (2) Perfusion (PERF)

An IV agent with particles larger than pulmonary capillaries mixes with pulmonary arterial blood and transiently lodges within capillaries/arterioles. Regional activity is proportional to blood flow, allowing depiction of perfusion and detection of perfusion defects.

## VIII. Clinical Applications

### (1) Classic indication: Pulmonary embolism (PE)

Early PE causes vascular occlusions with reduced/absent perfusion in affected segments while alveolar ventilation remains preserved. V/Q scintigraphy demonstrates characteristic **mismatch**: perfusion defects with corresponding normal ventilation — a key diagnostic sign enabling early detection and treatment planning.

### (2) Other applications

1. Evaluate pulmonary functional impact when systemic vasculitides (e.g., large‑vessel arteritis) involve pulmonary vessels.

2. Define distribution and severity in COPD to guide therapy and monitor response.

3. Assist in diagnosing pulmonary vascular malformations, pulmonary hypertension, and other pulmonary arterial diseases.

4. Support evaluation and follow‑up of parenchymal lung disease for treatment planning and response assessment.

5. Guide lobectomy candidacy, assess preoperative functional reserve, and monitor postoperative functional recovery.
